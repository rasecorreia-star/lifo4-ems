# SAFETY LIMITS — LiFePO4 BESS
# WARNING: These are HARDCODED in safety_manager.py as constants.
# This file is documentation only. Values cannot be overridden remotely.
# To change limits, a new software deployment is required (intentional).

cell_voltage:
  min_v: 2.5       # Absolute minimum — stop discharge immediately
  max_v: 3.65      # Absolute maximum — stop charge immediately
  delta_max_mv: 100 # Maximum imbalance between cells

pack_temperature:
  min_c: -10       # Stop all operations if below this
  max_c: 55        # Emergency stop if above this
  warn_c: 45       # Reduce power if above this

state_of_charge:
  absolute_min_pct: 5    # Emergency discharge stop
  absolute_max_pct: 98   # Emergency charge stop

current:
  overload_factor: 1.1   # Allow 10% over spec for <5 seconds (ramp)

grid:
  frequency_min_hz: 49.0   # Below this: grid failure detected
  frequency_max_hz: 51.0   # Above this: grid anomaly
  voltage_min_v: 180        # Below this: grid failure
  voltage_max_v: 265        # Above this: grid overvoltage
